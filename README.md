# Travel Management System


Nowadays people are more and more interested in traveling. So we chose this idea from the thought of making travel easier for travelers through this application. This application will have 3 users. Admin, employees, and customers. Admin will be able to access and update everything in this application. Employees will have limited access. They will be able to see various information about customers and act accordingly. However, if there is a complex problem, they will need admin approval. And customers will be able to open their own profiles and book the place where they love to go. And they can change their profile. Through this application, the user can safely go to their desired place without any hassle. Customers can easily get transportation, hotel accommodation, and catering facilities through this application. Users can also Shop for any accessories for traveling. And also users can book hotels, buy transport tickets, etc. So We will try to make this application more user-friendly.

# Appendix

This project is about travel management.Travel management  is a software platform that helps organizations manage and optimize their business travel. It is a central system that integrates various travel-related functions, including booking flights, hotels, and rental cars, managing expenses, and tracking employee travel.

One of the primary benefits of a TMS is that it streamlines the travel process, making it easier for employees to book and manage their travel arrangements. A TMS can also help organizations save money by negotiating discounts with suppliers and providing tools for managing and analyzing travel expenses.

In addition to booking and expense management, a TMS may also include features such as itinerary management, real-time flight updates, and travel risk management. Some TMSs also offer mobile apps that allow employees to access their travel information and make bookings on the go.

Some examples of TMSs include Concur, Sabre, and Amadeus. These systems are used by a wide range of organizations, including corporations, government agencies, and travel agencies.

Overall, a travel management system can greatly improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of business travel, making it an essential tool for any organization that frequently sends employees on the road.
